# ANN-Employee-Churn-Prediction-in-python
Employee Retention Prediction using ANN

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company. By analyzing various employee features, the model helps management take proactive steps to improve retention, such as offering personalized incentives or benefits.

Project Features
