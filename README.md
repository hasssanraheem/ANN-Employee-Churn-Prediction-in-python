# ANN-Employee-Churn-Prediction-in-python
Employee Retention Prediction using ANN

Designed and implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict employee attrition, enabling HR teams to take proactive retention measures. By analyzing features such as age, department, salary, tenure, and performance ratings, the model provides actionable insights on which employees are most at risk of leaving.

Key Highlights:

Built and trained an ANN classification model in Python to predict employee churn with high accuracy.

Preprocessed structured HR datasets to extract meaningful features and handle class imbalance.

Captured complex relationships between employee attributes through multiple hidden layers.

Generated a probability score for attrition risk, supporting data-driven retention strategies.

Evaluated model performance using standard classification metrics and optimized hyperparameters.

Delivered clean, well-documented code for ease of understanding and reproducibility.

Impact / Learning Outcomes:

Demonstrated end-to-end workflow of ANN-based predictive modeling on real-world HR data.

Enhanced skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning for business decision-making.

Gained experience integrating AI models into actionable insights for workforce management.
